## 🌀 What I'm Working On
- **Python scripts** to automate repetitive tasks (data collection, transformation, and visualization).  
- **Ethical hacking projects** and CTFs (Capture The Flag) to sharpen my cybersecurity skills.  
- **Collaborations with fellow geeks** who share a passion for solving technical puzzles.  

## 🔮 Future Endeavors
- Exploring **AI/ML techniques** to enhance automation and decision-making.
